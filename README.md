# google-cloud-certifications
Learning resources to study for [Google Cloud Certifications](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification).

The idea of this repo is to aggregate good resources to pass those certifications. Good resources mean:

* time efficient: I rather have 10 hours of good quality videos rather than a 900 pages book.
* relevant: the content is aligned with the needs of the exam.
* accessible: the content is easily accessible: either free or at a reasonable price.

general material relevant for all certifications
* review & understand the [Security foundations blueprint](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/security-foundations) (PDF document). It unpacks a lot of valuable information.
* [Google Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths) offers learning paths for each certifications. Good content with a mix of videos and labs.
